/*
 * Implementation note on memory ordering:
 *
 * Since concurrent GC like Shenandoah effectively publishes the forwardee copy
 * to concurrently running mutators, we need to consider the memory ordering
 * that comes with it. Most crucially, we need to ensure that all the stores to
 * the forwardee before its publication are visible to readers of the forwardee.
 * This is the GC hotpath, and thus the weakest synchronization should be used.
 *
 * Because the whole thing is the pointer-mediated publishing, the weakest way
 * to achieve this is Release-Consume ordering. But, because:
 *   a) we do not have "Consume" for in Hotspot;
 *   b) "Consume" gets promoted to "Acquire" by most current compilers
 *      (because doing otherwise requires tracking load dependencies);
 *   c) the use of "Consume" is generally discouraged in current C++;
 *
 * ...Release-Acquire ordering is as good. Hand-written arch-specific assembly code
 * can use data dependencies to provide "Consume" semantics that would not be
 * affected by C++ compilers.
 *
 * The criticial point where synchronization is needed are mark word accesses:
 *   1. markword loads that are then decoded into forwardee are marked with "acquire";
 *   2. markword loads that are not decoded into forwardee (e.g. is_forwarded) can still be relaxed;
 *   3. markword stores that publish new forwardee are marked with "release"
